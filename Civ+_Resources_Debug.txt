Intended Effects

Lumber Mills placed on Jungle (Civ+_Improvements.sql Lines 10-12, for Rubber and Bamboo improvement)

Cannabis: Grows on: Grassland+Hills, Plains+Hills, Desert, NOT on Features, +2 Gold +1 Faith +1 Culture, Plantation Improvement(+2G +.5 Housing)

Saffron: Should grow exclusively on Desert Floodplains. Original mods list valid features as Floodplain, but doesn't specify valid terrain
Desert. This might be a mistake in the original mod, I have replicated this state, and note this here just in case. For other resources,
like Rubber, it makes sense to designate only the valid features, Jungle can only appear on Grassland/Hills and Plains/Hills.

Caviar: Should only spawn in lakes, CHECK to ensure frequency 1 seafrequency 0 and lakeeligability 1 causes that.4
